# Mobile Teacher for iOS

Mobile Teacher seeks to democratize access to professional development opportunities for educators in developing countries (the majority world) with localized, user-created content delivered via their own phones. Teachers create and submit short videos of their effective classroom practices to share with other teachers so they can see someone that looks like them, teaching a context like theirs, and recognize their expertise.

This iOS application was built with the needs of the so-called “bottom of the pyramid” users in mind. The main challenge is that users in the majority world, while they have phones, do not necessarily have internet. The Mobile Teacher app needed to work offline. Design requirements for Mobile Teacher therefore followed strict guidelines set by Google, Android, and UNESCO with the unique needs of these users in mind at each step in the decision-making process.
